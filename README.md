Hey! So this is my first repository on GitHub, and I just wanted to try this out with a simple Python 3 dice roll game!

--gamemodes--

The game has two gamemodes:
-A boardgame, witch you can acces with !boardgame. It's a normal boardgame against an "AI" (actually just a random number generator)
-A dice rolling simulator, that is accessed with !rolldice. You can choose how many dice you wanna roll, and it shows a recap at the end, in a form of a list that shown how many of each number did you get.
-There is also !commandlist, that gives you a list of commands

--requirements--

You need Python 3 installed on your device. You can get if either from the Microsoft store, or download an installer from:
-[Windows page](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)

-[MacOS page](https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/)

Once you have the installer, run it and follow the instructions. Now you can run the game in any code editor/IDE for example VS code.
